Goals for this session
----------------------

1. How to determine PBPK model parameters: Brown et al.
	- Idea of inter-species extraploation through these parameters

2. Begin to make model more physiologically-realistic
	- Metabolism (Introduce liver compartment)
	- Elimination (Introduce kidney compartment)

3. Build basic RPT/D-RPT model
	- Build 4 compartment model (rapid, slow, liver, kidney)
	- Introduce metabolite (rapid, slow)

4. Compare model output to available data
	- Create python script to parse MCSim forward simulation
	- Create plot containing simulation results and data
